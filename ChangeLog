2007-02-27 v1.1.0
	* change some naming conventions in the directories
	* add a LQUP routine for small dimension (LUdivine_small) and the
	cascading with LUdivine
	* put the bound computations in the same file
	* add dense_generator.C for the generation of random dense
	matrices in tests
	* add the new algorithm for characteristic polynomial (temporarily
	named frobenius)
	
2006-08-11 v1.0.1
	* add the field implementation modular-positive.h, especially for
	p=2
	* add a the flag 'balanced' to the finite fields modular<double>,
	to switch to the apropriate bound computation (fgemm and trsm)
	* fix a bug in LUDivine LQUP elimination (initialisation of the
	permutation P for N=1 in the terminal case)
	* fix a bug in the determination of the number of recursive levels
	of Winograd Algorithm.
