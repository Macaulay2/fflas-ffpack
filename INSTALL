HOW TO USE IT :

This is a source library : no precompilation is required.
The usual way of using it is to include the file include/fflas_ffpack/fflas.h 
or include/fflas_ffpack/ffpack.h in your code.

The routines are designed to work with a generic finite field implementation, 
compliant with the interface of LinBox (www.linalg.org). We also provide two 
default implementations that make these routines work more efficiently.

* fflas_ffpack/modular-balanced.h : implements any prime finite field of cardinality between
3 and 2^25. The most efficient; to be used by default.

* fflas_ffpack/modular-positive.h : implements any prime finite field of cardinality between
2 and 2^25. 

REQUIREMENTS :

A C BLAS library must be installed in your environment : the file "cblas.h" 
must be in the include environment of the compilation and the associated
compiled library be provided to the linker.

For example, in the test directory, the test programms are compiled using the
C BLAS ATLAS; The following parameters are given to the compiler :

-I${ATLASROOT}/include -I${ATLASROOT}/include/${ATLASARCH}
-L ${ATLASROOT}/lib/${ATLASARCH} -lcblas -latlas

COMPILATION OF THE TESTS :

To compile the tests, complete the 3 variables given in test/Makefile :
ATLASROOT=         {the root directory where ATLAS is installed}
ATLASARCH=         {the architecture-system name given during ATLAS installation. 
		    for example Linux_P4SSE2}
ARCH=		   {the architecture parameter for g++. For example pentium4, athlon, ...}

Then simply run make in the test directory.
