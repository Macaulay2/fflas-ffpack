HOW TO USE IT :

This is a source library : no precompilation is required.
The usual way of using it is to include the file include/fflas_ffpack/fflas.h 
or include/fflas_ffpack/ffpack.h in your code.

The routines are designed to work with a generic finite field implementation, 
compliant with the interface of LinBox (www.linalg.org). We also provide two
default implementations that make these routines work more efficiently.

* fflas_ffpack/modular-balanced.h : implements any prime finite field of cardinality between larger than 2.
and smaller than 2^26 (Modular<double>) or 2^12 (Modular<float>).
The most efficient implementations ; to be used by default. 

* fflas_ffpack/modular-positive.h : implements any prime finite field of cardinality between
2 and 2^26 (Modular<double>) or 2^12 (Modular<float>). 

REQUIREMENTS :

A C BLAS library must be installed in your environment : the file "cblas.h" 
must be in the include environment of the compilation and the associated
compiled library be provided to the linker.

For example, in the test directory, the test programms are compiled using the
C BLAS ATLAS; The following parameters are given to the compiler :

-I${ATLASROOT}/include -I${ATLASROOT}/include/${ATLASARCH}
-L ${ATLASROOT}/lib/${ATLASARCH} -lcblas -latlas

COMPILATION OF THE TESTS :

To compile the tests, complete the variables given in test/Makefile and/or uncomment the adequate option:
BLASROOT=         {the directory where the BLAS library is located}
ARCH=		   {the architecture parameter for g++. For example pentium4, athlon, opteron,...}

Then simply run 

'make' 

in the test directory.

The compiled tests are the following files
tests/test-fgemm
tests/test-fgemv
tests/test-lqup
tests/test-charpoly
tests/test-compressQ
tests/test-frobenius
tests/test-fsquare
tests/test-det
tests/test-invert
tests/test-krylov-elim
tests/test-rank


COMPILATION OF THE SANITY/REGRESSION TESTS :

These tests require the GIVARO library and therefore also the GMP library.
First complete and uncomment the fields GIVARO_ROOT and GMP_ROOT in tests/Makefile.
Then run 

'make regression'.

The compiled tests are the following files

tests/testeur_fgemm.C
tests/testeur_lqup.C
tests/testeur_ftrsm.C
